iPython Notebook Web Scraping w/Requests and BeautifulSoup

This Python Web Scraping example is small and mediocre. It is for `quick n' dirty` work when you have nothing else to do on a Monday night.

Cleaning it up will be a project. Each one will be a new branch.

Feel free to explore, experience, and 

### Enjoy!!!
